      <p>
        You bought the Packout system because it is the most modular, stackable, lockable tool storage
        on the market. But stacking cases full of loose tools is just an expensive version of throwing
        everything in a bucket.
      </p>

      <p>
        The difference between a Packout that works and a Packout that slows you down comes down to
        what is inside each case. Here is how to set up a system that saves you time on every job.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 1: Audit Your Tools by Frequency</h2>

      <p>
        Before you organize anything, sort your tools into three categories:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Every job:</strong> These go in the top case of your stack. Drill/driver, impact, tape measure, speed square, utility knife, pencils. You reach for these 20+ times a day.</li>
        <li><strong>Most jobs:</strong> These go in the middle. Oscillating multi-tool, jigsaw, level, stud finder, pliers set, wire strippers. You need them 3 to 4 days a week.</li>
        <li><strong>Specialty:</strong> These go on the bottom or stay in the truck. Rotary hammer, pipe wrenches, specialty bits, demolition tools. Maybe once a week.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The goal is simple: the tools you grab most should require the least effort to access. Top of the
        stack, top of the case, closest to the latch.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 2: Match Cases to Tool Groups</h2>

      <p>
        Milwaukee makes over 20 Packout configurations. You do not need all of them. Here are the most
        useful combinations for different trades:
      </p>

      <h3>Electrician Setup</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>48-22-8435 Compact Organizer (top):</strong> Wire nuts, connectors, terminal screws, small parts in custom inserts</li>
        <li><strong>48-22-8424 Tool Box (middle):</strong> Drill/driver, impact, multi-tool, wire strippers, pliers, with custom 3D printed inserts</li>
        <li><strong>48-22-8425 Large Tool Box (bottom):</strong> Jigsaw, oscillating tool, fish tape, conduit bender fittings</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Carpenter / GC Setup</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>48-22-8443 3-Drawer (top):</strong> Bits, blades, fasteners organized in Gridfinity bins per drawer</li>
        <li><strong>48-22-8424 Tool Box (middle):</strong> Impact, drill, speed square, tape, pencils, utility knife in custom inserts</li>
        <li><strong>48-22-8426 Rolling Tool Box (base):</strong> Circular saw, reciprocating saw, bigger power tools</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Plumber Setup</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>48-22-8435 Compact Organizer (top):</strong> Fittings, tape, solder, flux, small parts sorted by type</li>
        <li><strong>48-22-8424 Tool Box (middle):</strong> Pipe wrench, channel locks, tubing cutter, PEX tools with custom inserts</li>
        <li><strong>48-22-8425 Large Tool Box (bottom):</strong> Propress tool, expansion tool, larger fittings inventory</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 3: Create Custom Inserts for Power Tools</h2>

      <p>
        This is where most people stop. They buy the Packout, throw tools in, and call it organized.
        But without inserts, tools shift in transit. You waste 30 seconds every time you dig for something.
        Over a full work week, that adds up to hours.
      </p>

      <p>
        Custom inserts solve this permanently. Every tool has a specific spot. You can see at a glance
        if something is missing. Tools do not bang into each other and get damaged.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you own a 3D printer, you can make inserts for any Packout case in about 5 minutes per tool.
        Photograph the tool on a sheet of paper, upload to <Link to="/editor">TracetoForge</Link>,
        select your case dimensions, and export an STL file. Print overnight and drop it in the case
        the next morning. A full case conversion takes a weekend of printing.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you do not have a 3D printer, Kaizen foam works but
        <Link to="/blog/3d-printed-inserts-vs-kaizen-foam"> costs significantly more per insert</Link> and
        degrades over time. Pre-made STL files on Etsy or Printables are another option if someone has already
        made the insert for your specific tool.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 4: Use Gridfinity for Small Parts</h2>

      <p>
        The Packout Compact Organizer and 3-Drawer models are perfect candidates
        for <Link to="/blog/gridfinity-insert-from-photo">Gridfinity bins</Link>. Print a baseplate
        sized to the drawer interior, then fill it with modular bins for:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Drill bits sorted by size</li>
        <li>Screws and fasteners by type</li>
        <li>Electrical connectors by gauge</li>
        <li>Plumbing fittings by size</li>
        <li>Allen keys, Torx bits, specialty drivers</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The advantage of Gridfinity inside Packout is flexibility. When a job calls for different fasteners,
        swap bins in 2 seconds. The baseplate stays. Only the bins change. You can also create
        custom bins with tool-shaped cutouts for items like calipers or wire strippers using the same
        photo-to-insert workflow.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 5: Label Everything</h2>

      <p>
        This sounds basic but almost nobody does it. Label each case on the outside with its contents.
        Use a label maker or print labels and cover with clear packing tape.
      </p>

      <p>
        When your Packout stack is 4 cases tall, you do not want to pop open every lid to find the one
        with the oscillating tool blades. A simple label on the front saves you from unstacking
        and restacking multiple times per day.
      </p>

      <p>
        For cases with custom inserts, the inserts themselves act as visual labels. Empty cavities tell you
        exactly what is missing. This is especially useful at the end of a job when you are packing up.
        One glance confirms every tool is accounted for.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 6: Plan Your Stack Order for the Job</h2>

      <p>
        The beauty of Packout is that you can reconfigure the stack for each job. Drywall day? Put the
        oscillating tool case on top. Rough electrical? Move the connector organizer up. Trim work?
        The case with the finish nailer and brad nails goes on top.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some tradespeople keep a "daily driver" stack of 2 to 3 cases that covers 80% of jobs, then
        add specialty cases as needed. Others build a full rolling stack in the truck and pull cases
        individually for each task. Find what works for your workflow and stick with it.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 7: Maintain the System</h2>

      <p>
        Organization is not a one-time project. It is a habit. At the end of every job:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Put every tool back in its insert</li>
        <li>Check for empty cavities (missing tools)</li>
        <li>Restock consumables (blades, bits, fasteners)</li>
        <li>Clean out debris and dust</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This takes 5 minutes. It prevents the slow slide back to chaos that happens when you start
        tossing tools in "just for now."
      </p>

      <h2>Common Packout Interior Dimensions</h2>

      <p>
        If you are making custom inserts, here are the approximate interior dimensions for the most
        popular Packout cases. Always measure yours to confirm:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>48-22-8435 Compact Organizer:</strong> ~390 x 245 x 63mm</li>
        <li><strong>48-22-8424 Tool Box:</strong> ~480 x 295 x 120mm</li>
        <li><strong>48-22-8425 Large Tool Box:</strong> ~480 x 295 x 315mm</li>
        <li><strong>48-22-8443 3-Drawer:</strong> ~390 x 245 x 50mm per drawer</li>
        <li><strong>48-22-8422 Small Tool Box:</strong> ~390 x 245 x 120mm</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>How many Packout cases do I actually need?</h3>
      <p>
        Most tradespeople work best with 3 to 5 cases plus a rolling base. Start with 2 and add as you
        identify tools that need their own home. Buying empty cases "just in case" leads to disorganization.
      </p>

      <h3>Should I use the Packout bins or 3D printed inserts?</h3>
      <p>
        Milwaukee's own Packout bins and dividers work fine for general sorting. For tool-specific cavities
        where each tool has an exact spot, 3D printed inserts are better. Most organized setups use both:
        bins for consumables and inserts for tools.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I fit Gridfinity baseplates in Packout drawers?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. The 3-Drawer model's interior dimensions fit Gridfinity baseplates well. Print a baseplate
        to match the drawer width and depth, secure it with double-sided tape or friction fit, and fill
        with standard Gridfinity bins.
      </p>

      <h3>What material should I print Packout inserts in?</h3>
      <p>
        PETG for job-site use. It handles heat (truck beds in summer), resists chemicals (solvents, oils),
        and is tougher than PLA. For stationary shop use, PLA is fine and easier to print.
      </p>

      <h3>How long does it take to organize a full Packout system?</h3>
      <p>
        Plan on one weekend. Day 1: audit tools, plan layouts, photograph tools, generate inserts. Day 2:
        print inserts (most print in 1 to 4 hours each), install, and load. After the initial setup,
        maintaining takes 5 minutes per day.
      </p>

      <h2>Start With One Case</h2>

      <p>
        Do not try to organize everything at once. Pick the case you open most often. Create inserts for
        the 5 to 8 tools inside. Live with it for a week. The satisfaction of opening a perfectly organized
        case will motivate you to do the rest.
